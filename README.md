Code1 : Performing the basic mathematical operation using tensorflow session API.
        It reads the imput from input.txt and generates output in output.txt file.

Code2 : Implementing a given CNN network for classification on CIFAR-10 Data Set.
        We have to specify the data path. 
        For visualizing on tensorboard we keep the logs after each epochs.Hence need to specify the log directory path.
        Also storing the checkpoint after each epoch hence we have to specify it's path.
        
        Accuracy on ting data: 60%
        
Code 3: A  CNN based network for CIFAR-10 classification.
        We have to specify the data path. 
        For visualizing on tensorboard we keep the logs after each epochs.Hence need to specify the log directory path.
        Also storing the checkpoint after each epoch hence we have to specify it's path.
        
        Accuracy on testing data: 70.03%
